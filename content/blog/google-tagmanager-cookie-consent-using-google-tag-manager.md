Some annoying client asked you to add a Cookie Consent to his page because of the new GDPR rule in germany where you are only allowed to load tracking cookies if the user actively says "Yes"?

GTM --> Google Tag Manager

## Google Tag Manager

Head to [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com) and log in with the Google Account you use for your work. Once you're logged in click on "Create Account" and fill in the data accordingly and choose "Web" at the target platform. Click on create and accept the GTM Policy. Also add the two snippets GTM provides you with to the according places.

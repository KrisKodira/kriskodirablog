What you should plan before starting to code a website:

* Consider the tech stack you will use:
Does the client want a blog he can edit? If it's nothing complicated think of using something like forestry and Gatsby or Jekyll with Gitlab CI/CD or Github Actions. If the client wants a lot of pages and instant updates consider using something like Craft CMS, Grav, your own CMS.

* Make a data structure
Open draw.io or coggle and write down all the pages that the client needs. After that write down all the blocks that will be present in the blocks. Let's say the page is the homepage so some possible blocks would be a menu, header, what the client offers, projects the client already did, contact form and a footer. Now write down what the fields for those blocks are e.g. for the header you could write down a hero image, a title, a cta with link and button text and so on. That's what you do for all pages and blocks. Repeatable blocks like the header you obviously don't need to describe in detail with the fields on all pages. On the other pages with the same headers you just write down the header. This will make development much easier since you can refer back to your data structure while coding and you will think about much more things right now before coding and you will already solve problems you would first consider while coding which saves you a lot of time. 
Think of privacy policy, possible cookies you will set for login or analytics, consider making a cookie banner and data structure for that, think of input fields for forms, newsletters or possible frontmatter fields.

* Create a wireframe based on your data structure:
Decide where to place all the images, headlines, labels and the sections. This will help you during your design and you will already see flaws in your data structure that you can correct right away.

* Now you can start with your detailed design based on all the steps you made first. This will be much easier than doing it in the first step right away.

After all these steps you can start coding and it will save you a lot of time since all the things you did before you already considered a lot of steps and found problems that you would have found later on which makes your code messy.

Tada these are my go to steps!

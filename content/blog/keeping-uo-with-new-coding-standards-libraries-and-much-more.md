Every day you find out about a new JS library and you are wondering where it came from?

## Ultimate pages to follow for keeping up

It's always good to check some articles on pages like these:

* [Hackernoon](Hackernoon)

  Why Hackernoon?

  You get news and tutorials from all kinds of things. Starting with business tips all the way to new coding standards, AI and coding philosophy.
* [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/)

  Why Hashnode?

  Pretty much the same as Hackernoon but here you also get much more code specific tutorials.

## Other ways of keeping up

* Try using some new libraries in your projects and either like them or hate them and learn something new from them
* Feel stuck at work? Get a new job even if you're not 100% qualified â€“ you can learn so much on the job
* Join Telegram groups with other developers or Discord channels that focus on development. Check out what they are talking about and also bring up some topics you're interested in.

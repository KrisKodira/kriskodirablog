Thats me!

I'm a 23 year old web developer who was born in Croatia and lives in Frankfurt, Germany. Currently I work for a marketing agency called "Vier f√ºr Texas" in Frankfurt am Main in the furious "Bahnhofsviertel". It's bad but then again it's not THAT bad. You can survive as long as you don't stare anyone in the eyes 

**Enjoy!**

# Welcome to my Blog!

Thats me!

I'm a 23 year old web developer who was born in Croatia and lives in Frankfurt, Germany. Currently I work for a marketing agency called "Vier für Texas" in Frankfurt am Main in the furious "Bahnhofsviertel". It's bad but then again it's not THAT bad. You can survive as long as you don't stare anyone in the eyes 👀.

In my free time I enjoy making myself some Coffee with my Bialetti, writing a few blog posts here and there, riding my motorcycle if it's not too cold, going to the gym for a workout and the spa, spending time with friends and family and obviously coding away 👨‍💻

My interests on the more technical side are Web Development (Front & Back), native SWIFT development, Kotlin Android development and building my own PCs.
